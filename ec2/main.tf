// this OpenTofu main.tf will create a small ec2 instance into aws, with a public ip, and the nginx web server. 
// You will need to supply an aws keypair below (search for mykeypair)
// before this will run, and have the aws cli installed for your system

// the docs for aws cli install are here: 
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

// You may prefer to keep the state on your local system, rather than setting up a remote state S3 bucket and
// dynamo DB table while learning, so you can comment out the backend block if you decide to use local state

// before the website will open, ensure that the Security Group for the ec2 instance has opened port 80 
// (and port 22 if you wish to ssh to it) to your public IP (use whatismyip.com to find). This can be programmed
// easily in OpenTofu for future sessions.

// Be sure to $tofu destroy when you are done, so the instance does not incur fees after your testing
